# API Review 05/11/2023

## EnableKernelResponseBuffering

**Approved** | [#aspnetcore/47777](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47777#issuecomment-1544304751)

API Review Notes:

1. The per-request feature is additive and could be added later. It sounds like it could be useful, but no customer has specifically asked for it.
2. As to the question about whether we should enable kernel response buffering by default, @davidni made the following comment on the PR pointing out that there are real downsides to enabling it, so it seems safest not to
    > Side-note for posterity -- when I played with HTTP.sys perf on Asp .NET Core back in the day, one of our experiments was to NOT enable HTTP.sys buffering, and instead to do overlapped writes, ensuring there were always at least N outstanding writes. This helped improve perf in our scenarios (proxying large responses from a destination service -- before YARP), but (surprisingly at the time) we were never able to achieve the same throughput that http.sys kernel buffering afforded.

API Approved!

## Make Http Logging Middleware Endpoint aware

**Approved** | [#aspnetcore/43222](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43222#issuecomment-1544770052)

API Review Notes:

- WCF uses a pattern where attributes use `Nullable<int>` properties and no corresponding constructor parameter. You cannot set the property to `null`, but you could add bool properties like `IsRequestBodyLogLimitSet`.
  - @Tratcher and @mconnew prefer the extra properties because it's more explicit than `-1`.
  - The get-only properties will not show up in intellisense when defining the attribute.
  - The `RequestBodyLogLimit` and `ResponseBodyLogLimit` getters should throw an `InvalidOperationException` if unset.
- @BrennanConroy and @halter73 are poisoned by working on `System.IO.Pipelines`, so we think `-1` for "unlimited" makes sense

API Approved with IsSet properties!

## Obsolete KestrelServer (just the public type, not all of Kestrel!)

**Blocked** | [#aspnetcore/47686](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47686#issuecomment-1544785505)

API Review Notes:

- @mconnew says he wants this API for CoreWCF.
  - It already uses it [here](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/blob/8aad8508d82a65bc6ca79178943321fa9bf70f24/src/CoreWCF.NetTcp/src/CoreWCF/Channels/NetTcpHostedService.cs#L66-L67).
  - Can we just use separate IServiceCollections/providers?
    - They want a shared DI container for multiple server instances.
    - Could Kestrel's IServer ServiceDescriptor be copied as transient? üòù 
      - This was a joke, but it needs to work when IIS is the main `IServer` for the container.
- What if hosting just started every `IServer` instead? This could be super breaking for existing apps expecting the last one to win. See https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27213
- Instead should `KestrelServer` be the real `IServer` instead of `KestrelServerImpl` again?
  - It's annoying to make public API changes every time we consume a new service in Kestrel.
- If we did obsolete this, we would not delete it until @mconnew's scenario is addressed.
- The main issue this address is that this type does not support HTTP/3, and that seems worthwhile even though this isn't commonly used to begin with.

Blocked on #27213.
## Add TryAddPolicyRegistry extension methods for IPolicyRegistry

**Rejected** | [#aspnetcore/47842](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47842#issuecomment-1544790243)

API Review Notes:

- Let's make the existing non-`Try` `AddPolicyRegistry` extension methods use `TryAdd` or `TryAddEnumerable` for the services where it makes sense to do so. We don't have `TryAddMvc`, yet `AddMvc` `TryAdd`'s many things.
- This could technically be a breaking change, but all bug fixes are. If we think there's a high chance of breakage, we could consider new API, but we'd prefer not to make any API changes and just do the right thing.

API rejected, but we like using `TryAdd` and `TryAddEnumerable` in the existing methods.
## Support all error's status codes ProblemDetail types for generating swagger docs in MinimalApi

**Rejected** | [#aspnetcore/47705](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47705#issuecomment-1544808236)

API Review Notes:

- We do not want to duplicate all of our non-200-returning `IResult` types and `TypedResult` methods to have a `ProblemDetails` variation.
  -  We already have special types for many status codes like `UnauthorizedHttpResult` for non-ProblemDetails returning APIs that return a 401. Same goes for many other status codes.
  - We think 400 for `ValidationProblem` is a special case, but we don't want to extend this pattern for every status code since it requires a new type and method per status code.
- Others error status codes, like `InternalProbelm`, `UnAuthorizedProblem`, `NotFoundProblem`... is not specific enough for approving the API, but even if they were all listed out, we'd be unlikely to accept the API.

We encourage using `TypedResults.Problem` with the `ProducesProblem` `IEndpointConventionBuilder` extension method either on the endpoint or a `RouteGroup` returned by `MapGroup`. For example:

```csharp
var hasUnauthorizedProblemsGroup = endpoints.MapGroup("");

hasUnauthorizedProblemsGroup.MapPost("/products",
    Results<ProblemHttpResult, Ok<ProductDto>>(ProductDto product) =>
    {
        if ( some condition )
           return TypedResults.Problem(statusCode: 401);
         
         return TypedResults.Ok(product);
    });

hasUnauthorizedProblemGroup.ProducesProblem(401);
```

You can also use `Produces` directly on the `MapPost` call:

```csharp
endpoints.MapPost("/products", ...).ProducesProblem(401);
```

Thanks for submitting the API proposal, but we have decided to reject it.
