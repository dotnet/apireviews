# API Review 07/14/2022

## Public API for "Compiler needs to declaratively fail when loading newer analyzers"

**Rejected** | [#roslyn/62583](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/62583#issuecomment-1183823089)

Conclusion from internal thread is to take this API as-is except we will make the 'init' accessor internal.
